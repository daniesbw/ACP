Algorithm Comparison Application (ACP) - JavaScript & C#
========================================================

This ACP project is a multifaceted collaboration between technologies utilizing JavaScript (Node.js) and C# (Visual Studio) to analyze and compare algorithms. It's designed to provide an integrated perspective on algorithm performance and efficiency across multiple programming environments and languages.

Description
-----------

The ACP serves as an interactive tool for exploring how various algorithms behave across different programming environments. With implementations in both JavaScript and C#, users can execute and compare algorithms in real-time, offering valuable insights for developers and tech enthusiasts.

Features
--------

*   **Dual Implementations**: Algorithms implemented in both JavaScript (Node.js) and C# (Visual Studio).
*   **Interactive Interface**: Facilitates the execution and comparison of algorithms in both environments.
*   **Performance Analysis**: Measures and compares execution time, memory usage, and other relevant KPIs.
*   **Extensive Documentation**: Includes documentation on each algorithm and its behavior in different environments.

Prerequisites
-------------

For this project, you will need:

*   Node.js installed on your system (for JavaScript code).
*   Visual Studio 2022 or later (for C# code).

Installation
------------

### For JavaScript code:

1.  Clone the repository and navigate to the JavaScript directory.
2.  Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3.  Use `node <script_name>.js` to execute the algorithms.

### For C# code:

1.  Clone the repository and open the solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Build the project and run it from the IDE.

Usage
-----

Select the algorithm you wish to compare and execute it in both the JavaScript and C# environments. Observe and compare the results in terms of efficiency and performance.
